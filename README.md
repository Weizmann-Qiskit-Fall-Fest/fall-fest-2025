## 💻 Workshops & Challenges

We will host several **hands-on quantum computing workshops** and **challenge tracks** for all skill levels:

### **Beginner**
- Quantum computing basics  
- Running your first quantum circuit in Qiskit  
- Measurement and noise simulation

### **Intermediate**
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)  
- Error mitigation and noise-aware circuits  
- Quantum optimization tasks

### **Advanced (optional)**
- Pulse-level control in Qiskit  
- Using provider-specific tools like **QEDMA's QESEM** for enhanced simulations

> **Goal:** By the end of the day, you’ll have **run a real quantum circuit**, **solved a challenge**, and connected with other quantum enthusiasts.
