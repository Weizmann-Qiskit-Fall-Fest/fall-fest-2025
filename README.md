## 🏆 The Hackathon

The **Weizmann Qiskit Fall Fest 2025** is built around a **mystery quantum computing challenge**.  
You’ll work in teams to design, build, and demo a solution using **Qiskit** and real quantum computing concepts.

- **Teams:** Solo or groups of up to 4  
- **Challenge Reveal:** Announced at the opening ceremony  
- **Support:** Mentors will be available throughout the day to answer questions and help guide teams  
- **Resources:** Starter code and learning materials provided so participants of all levels can take part

At the end of the day, teams will present their work in a **short demo session**.  
Projects will be evaluated on creativity, technical correctness, and clarity of presentation, with prizes for the top teams!

## 💻 Workshops & Talks

In addition to the hackathon, there will be **mini-workshops** and **lightning talks** throughout the day.  
These will help participants:
- Learn the basics of quantum computing and Qiskit
- Explore advanced topics like quantum optimization and error mitigation
- Hear from local researchers and industry professionals about cutting-edge quantum research
