## 💻 Workshops & Challenges

We will host several **hands-on quantum computing workshops** and **challenge tracks** for all skill levels:

### **Beginner**
- Quantum computing basics  
- Running your first quantum circuit in Qiskit  
- Measurement and noise simulation

### **Intermediate**
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)  
- Error mitigation and noise-aware circuits  
- Quantum optimization tasks

### **Advanced (optional)**
- Pulse-level control in Qiskit  
- Using provider-specific tools like **QEDMA's QESEM** for enhanced simulations

> **Goal:** By the end of the day, you’ll have **run a real quantum circuit**, **solved a challenge**, and connected with other quantum enthusiasts.

## 🏆 The Hackathon

The **Weizmann Qiskit Fall Fest 2025** is built around a **day-long Qiskit hackathon**.  
Throughout the day, you’ll work in teams to tackle a surprise quantum computing challenge that will be revealed during the opening ceremony.

- **Teams:** Work solo or form a team of up to 4 participants.  
- **Goal:** Use Qiskit to design, build, and demo a creative solution to the challenge using real quantum computing concepts.  
- **Mystery Challenge:** The exact problem will remain **secret until the event begins** to ensure a level playing field.  
- **Support:** Mentors and Qiskit experts will be available throughout the day to answer questions and help unblock teams.  
- **Resources:** We’ll provide notebooks, starter code, and learning materials so everyone—from beginners to advanced quantum developers—can contribute.

The day is structured to give you **plenty of focused hacking time**, while also featuring inspiring talks, quick workshops, and food breaks to keep the energy high.

At the end of the event, each team will give a **3-minute demo** of their project to our judges.  
Projects will be evaluated on:
- Creativity and originality  
- Technical correctness  
- Clarity of presentation  
- Potential impact or usefulness

Prizes will be awarded to the top teams, and all participants will gain valuable experience, new skills, and connections in the quantum computing community.
